# Installation

To install MindPalace, you need to have Python 3.9 or higher installed. We recommend setting up a new virtual environment specifically for MindPalace:

## Create a Virtual Environment

### Using Conda

If you're using Conda as your package and environment management tool, you can create a new virtual environment with Python 3.9 using the following commands:

```bash
# Create a new virtual environment named 'mindpalace' with Python 3.9
conda create -n mindpalace python=3.9

# Activate the virtual environment
conda activate mindpalace
```

### Using Virtualenv

Alternatively, if you prefer `virtualenv`, you can install it first (if it's not already installed) and then create a new virtual environment as shown:

```bash
# Install virtualenv if it is not already installed
pip install virtualenv

# Create a new virtual environment named 'mindpalace' with Python 3.9
virtualenv mindpalace --python=python3.9

# Activate the virtual environment
source mindpalace/bin/activate  # On Windows use `mindpalace\Scripts\activate`
```
